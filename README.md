# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly Detection is the technique by which we identify data points or observations in a dataset that differ significantly from standard behavior or patterns. Generally, we call these data points Outliers. In Python, we have an algorithm called Isolation Forest Algorithm which can help us in detecting outliers or anomalies. 
Anomaly Detection can be used in various real-life problems such as Fraud Detection, Credit-Risk Analysis, etc.
